## What Works

### Web Application (PhotoVault Server)
1. ✅ Homepage with branding
2. ✅ User registration and login
3. ✅ Photo upload and gallery
4. ✅ AI photo enhancement (colorization, sharpening, restoration)
5. ✅ Family vaults for shared albums
6. ✅ Mobile API endpoints with JWT authentication
7. ✅ Hybrid authentication (session for web, JWT for mobile)

### iOS Application (StoryKeep)
1. ✅ User authentication (login/register)
2. ✅ Biometric login support
3. ✅ Smart Camera for photo digitization
4. ✅ Photo gallery with real-time sync
5. ✅ Dashboard with user stats
6. ✅ Family vaults viewer
7. ✅ Profile management
8. ✅ Settings screen

## Testing the iOS App

1. **Install Expo Go** on your iPhone from the App Store
2. **Scan the QR code** shown in the Expo Server workflow console
3. **Alternative**: Open the tunnel URL `exp://xm_vc_e-anonymous-8081.exp.direct` in Expo Go

## Production Deployment

The production version is deployed on Railway:
- **Production URL**: https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app
- **iOS App Connection**: Configured to use Railway production API
- **Note**: Any changes made locally need to be pushed to GitHub and deployed to Railway for the iOS app to see them

## Next Steps

You can now:
1. Test the web application at http://127.0.0.1:5000
2. Test the iOS app by scanning the QR code with Expo Go
3. Continue development and add new features
4. Deploy changes to Railway for production use

## Important Notes

- **Development vs Production**: 
  - Local Replit server is for development only
  - Railway server is production (what iOS app uses)
  - Changes must be pushed to GitHub and deployed to Railway to be visible in production

- **Database**:
  - Local Replit has its own PostgreSQL database (for development)
  - Railway has separate production database
  - They are not synchronized

- **Workflows**:
  - Both workflows restart automatically after system reboots
  - PhotoVault Server must run on port 5000
  - Expo Server uses tunnel mode for remote access

## All Systems Green ✅

The import migration is complete and both servers are running successfully with no critical errors.
