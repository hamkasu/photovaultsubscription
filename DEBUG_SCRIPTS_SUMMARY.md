# üéØ Debug & Monitoring Scripts - Summary

I've created a complete monitoring and debugging toolkit for your PhotoVault project.

## üì¶ What's Been Added

### 1. **monitor_railway.py** ‚úÖ

**Features:**
- Checks all critical endpoints (/, /health, /api, /api/health/db)
- Measures response times
- Detects 502 Bad Gateway errors
- Continuous watch mode (updates every 5 seconds)

**Test Result:**
```bash

‚úÖ API Health           | Status: 200 | Time:      8ms
‚úÖ Database Health      | Status: 200 | Time:     32ms
‚úÖ Database             | Connected and responsive
   üìä Users: 0 | Photos: 0 | Plans: 5

‚úÖ ALL CHECKS PASSED (5/5)
üéâ Local server is healthy!
```

**Features:**
- Tests public endpoints (homepage, login, register)
- Tests mobile API endpoints (/api/auth/login, /api/auth/register)
- Can test local, Railway, or both
- Provides success rate percentage
- Detailed response data for debugging

**Usage:**
```bash
python test_api.py          # Test both
python test_api.py local    # Local only
python test_api.py railway  # Railway only
```

---

### 4. **check_logs.sh** ‚úÖ
Quick log viewer for both workflows.

**Features:**
- Shows last 20 lines from PhotoVault Server
- Shows last 20 lines from Expo Server
- Automatically detects errors/exceptions
- Provides tips for real-time monitoring

**Status:** ‚úÖ **TESTED & WORKING**

**Test Result:**
```bash
$ ./check_logs.sh
‚úÖ Latest log: /tmp/logs/PhotoVault_Server_20251018_114001_352.log
‚úÖ No errors found in recent logs
‚úÖ Latest log: /tmp/logs/Expo_Server_20251018_114020_838.log
```

---

### 5. **MONITORING_GUIDE.md** üìö
Complete documentation for all monitoring tools.

**Includes:**
- Detailed usage instructions for each script
- Troubleshooting workflows
- Pre/post-deployment checklists
- Common issues and solutions
- Log interpretation guide
- Automation suggestions

---

### 6. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** üìã
One-page cheat sheet for daily use.

**Includes:**
- Common commands
- URL references
- Quick diagnostics
- Status code guide
- Emergency fixes
- Daily workflow checklist

---

### 7. **RAILWAY_WORKER_TIMEOUT_FIX.md** üîß
Deployment fix documentation.

**Includes:**
- Problem identification
- Solution explanation
- Deployment steps
- Verification checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Check Everything is Working:

```bash
# 1. Local server health
python monitor_local.py

# 2. Railway deployment (after you deploy the fix)
python monitor_railway.py

# 3. View recent logs
./check_logs.sh

# 4. Full API test
python test_api.py
```

### Continuous Monitoring (Recommended During Development):

```bash
# Terminal 1: Monitor local server
python monitor_local.py --watch

# Terminal 2: Your development work
# (Make changes, test features, etc.)

# Terminal 3 (optional): Monitor Railway
python monitor_railway.py --watch
```

## üìä Current Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Local Server | ‚úÖ **HEALTHY** | All checks passing, 0 errors in logs |
| Expo Server | ‚úÖ **RUNNING** | QR code available at exp://lav0wc0-anonymous-8081.exp.direct |
| Railway Production | ‚ö†Ô∏è **502 ERROR** | Worker timeout issue - FIX READY TO DEPLOY |
| Monitoring Scripts | ‚úÖ **WORKING** | All 4 scripts tested and functional |

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy Railway Fix (Recommended)

The Railway worker timeout fix is ready in these files:
- ‚úÖ Dockerfile (added --preload)
- ‚úÖ Procfile (added --preload)
- ‚úÖ nixpacks.toml (added --preload)

**To deploy:**
```bash
git add Dockerfile Procfile nixpacks.toml
git commit -m "Fix Railway worker timeout with --preload flag"
git push origin main

# Then monitor deployment
python monitor_railway.py --watch
```

### 2. Use Monitoring During Development

```bash
# Keep this running in a terminal
python monitor_local.py --watch
```

This will alert you immediately if:
- Server crashes
- Database disconnects
- Endpoints stop responding
- Response times increase

### 3. Pre-Deployment Testing

Before every Railway deploy:
```bash
python test_api.py local
```

This ensures local environment is working before pushing to production.

## üí° Best Practices

### Daily Workflow

**Morning:**
```bash
python monitor_local.py    # Verify local is healthy
python monitor_railway.py  # Verify production is healthy
```

**During Development:**
```bash
python monitor_local.py --watch  # Keep running in separate terminal
```

**Before Committing:**
```bash
python test_api.py local   # Ensure all tests pass
./check_logs.sh            # Check for errors
```

**After Railway Deploy:**
```bash
python monitor_railway.py --watch  # Watch until healthy
python test_api.py railway         # Verify all endpoints
```

---

## üîç Debugging Workflows

### Server Not Responding
```
1. python monitor_local.py
2. ./check_logs.sh
3. Check workflow in Replit UI
4. Restart PhotoVault Server workflow
5. Wait 10-15 seconds
6. python monitor_local.py (verify)
```

### Railway 502 Errors
```
1. python monitor_railway.py
2. Check Railway dashboard logs
3. Verify latest code is deployed
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for rebuild
5. python monitor_railway.py --watch
```

### API Tests Failing
```
1. python monitor_local.py (check health)
2. ./check_logs.sh (look for errors)
3. curl http://localhost:5000/health (basic test)
4. Fix issues in code
5. python test_api.py local (verify fix)
```

## üìû Support

All scripts include helpful error messages and suggestions. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the MONITORING_GUIDE.md for detailed troubleshooting
2. Review QUICK_REFERENCE.md for common solutions
3. Use `./check_logs.sh` to see recent error logs
4. Check Railway dashboard for deployment issues
