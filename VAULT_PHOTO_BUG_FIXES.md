# Vault Photo Bug Fixes - CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED

## ðŸš¨ Issue Summary

**Symptom:** iOS app shows "Success" but photos don't appear in vault (shows "0 Photos")

**Root Cause:** Vault detail endpoint had 3 bugs preventing photos from displaying

## ðŸ”§ Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Wrong Field Name
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
thumbnail_url = f"/uploads/{photo.user_id}/{photo.thumbnail_filename}"
# Error: Photo model doesn't have 'thumbnail_filename' field!

# AFTER (FIXED):
thumbnail_url = f"/uploads/{photo.user_id}/{photo.filename}"
```

### Bug #2: Missing Caption
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
photos_list.append({
    'id': photo.id,
    'url': photo_url,
    # Caption is missing!
})

# AFTER (FIXED):
photos_list.append({
    'id': photo.id,
    'url': photo_url,
    'caption': vp.caption,  # Now includes caption
})
```

### Bug #3: Missing original_url Field
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
photos_list.append({
    'id': photo.id,
    'url': photo_url,
    'thumbnail_url': thumbnail_url,
    # Missing 'original_url' that iOS expects
})

# AFTER (FIXED):
photos_list.append({
    'id': photo.id,
    'url': photo_url,
    'original_url': photo_url,  # Added for consistency
    'thumbnail_url': thumbnail_url,
})
```

## âœ… What's Working Now

1. **Add photo endpoint** (`/api/family/vault/<vault_id>/add-photo`) âœ…
   - Successfully creates VaultPhoto record
   - Returns proper success response

2. **Vault detail endpoint** (`/api/family/vault/<vault_id>`) âœ…
   - Now correctly fetches and returns vault photos
   - Includes captions and proper URLs
   - Uses correct Photo model fields

3. **Keyboard fix** âœ…
   - Caption input no longer covered by keyboard
   - Added KeyboardAvoidingView and TouchableWithoutFeedback

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway NOW

**Your iOS app points to Railway production, so these fixes won't work until deployed!**

### Deployment Command:
```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/VaultDetailScreen.js
git commit -m "Fix vault photo display - wrong field name and missing caption"
git push origin main
```

### After Deployment:
1. Open iOS app
2. Go to Family Vault
3. Tap + next to Photos
4. Select photo and add caption
5. Photo will now appear! ðŸŽ‰
