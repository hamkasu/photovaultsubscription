### Libraries
- **CameraX**: Modern camera API with advanced controls
- **OpenCV**: Edge detection and image processing
- **Room**: Local database for offline storage
- **WorkManager**: Background upload queue
- **Retrofit**: REST API client
- **Glide**: Image loading and caching
- **Material Design 3**: Modern UI components

## Building

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 34
- OpenCV Android SDK

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio
3. Update `local.properties` with your Android SDK path
4. Update API base URL in `build.gradle`:
   - Debug: Points to `http://10.0.2.2:5000` (localhost from emulator)
   - Release: Points to your production server

### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Release build
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Install on device
./gradlew installDebug
```

## Configuration

### API Endpoint
Update the API base URL in `app/build.gradle`:
```gradle
buildTypes {
    debug {
        buildConfigField "String", "API_BASE_URL", "\"http://your-server:5000\""
    }
    release {
        buildConfigField "String", "API_BASE_URL", "\"https://photovault.calmic.com\""
    }
}
```

### OpenCV Setup
The app uses OpenCV 4.8.0 for image processing. **Critical setup required:**

1. **Download OpenCV Android SDK**:
   - Download from https://opencv.org/releases/ (version 4.8.0)
   - Extract the SDK

2. **Add to project**:
   - Copy `opencv/build/outputs/aar/opencv-4.8.0.aar` to `app/libs/`
   - Create the `libs` directory if it doesn't exist

3. **Alternative - Use Maven** (uncomment in build.gradle):
   ```gradle
   implementation 'com.quickbirdstudios:opencv:4.5.3.0'
   ```

**Important**: The app will run without OpenCV but edge detection and auto-enhancement will be disabled.

```

## Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
- `CAMERA` - For camera access
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - For accessing photos (Android 12 and below)
- `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES` - For accessing photos (Android 13+)
- `INTERNET` - For API communication
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - For checking connectivity

## Usage

1. **Launch App**: Login or register an account
2. **Capture Photos**: Tap the camera button
3. **Position Photo**: Align the physical photo in the viewfinder
4. **Auto-Detection**: Green overlay shows detected edges
5. **Capture**: Tap the capture button
6. **Enhancement**: Photo is automatically enhanced
7. **Batch Mode**: Enable for multiple rapid captures
8. **Upload**: Photos are queued for upload automatically

## API Integration

The app integrates with the PhotoVault Flask backend:
- Authentication endpoints: `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`
- Photo upload: `/upload`
- Gallery: `/gallery/photos`
- Family vaults: `/family/vaults`
- Face detection: `/api/photo-detection/extract`

## Offline Capabilities

- All captured photos are stored locally first
- Upload queue manages background sync
- Photos remain accessible even without internet
- Automatic retry on network errors
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits

## Performance

- Image processing is done on background threads
- CameraX ensures smooth preview and capture
- WorkManager handles efficient background uploads
- Glide provides memory-efficient image loading
- Room database optimized with indices

## Security

- JWT token-based authentication
- Tokens stored securely in SharedPreferences
- HTTPS for all API communications
- Local photos encrypted at rest
- No sensitive data in logs
