# Fix Pillow Dependency Conflict on Railway

## Issue
Railway deployment is failing with this error:
```
ERROR: Cannot install -r requirements.txt (line 157) and Pillow==11.0.0 because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.
pillow-heif 1.1.1 depends on pillow>=11.1.0
```

## Solution
The requirements.txt file has been cleaned up:
- âœ… Removed all duplicate package entries
- âœ… Updated Pillow from `==11.0.0` to `>=11.1.0` (compatible with pillow-heif)
- âœ… Organized packages into logical sections with comments

## Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Fix Pillow dependency conflict for Railway deployment"
```

### Step 2: Push to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to your Railway dashboard: https://railway.app/
2. Select your project: `web-production-535bd`
3. Watch the deployment logs - it should now build successfully
4. The build process will install Pillow 11.3.0 (or latest compatible version)

## What Was Fixed
- **Before**: requirements.txt had 4 duplicate copies of every package
- **After**: Clean, organized requirements.txt with unique entries only
- **Pillow**: Changed from `==11.0.0` to `>=11.1.0` for pillow-heif compatibility

## Verification
Once deployed, your Railway app will support:
- iOS HEIC/HEIF image uploads (via pillow-heif)
- All image processing features (opencv, scikit-image)
- AI features (openai, google-genai)
- Payment processing (stripe)
- Email notifications (sendgrid)

The deployment should complete successfully now! ðŸš€
