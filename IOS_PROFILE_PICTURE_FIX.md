# iOS Profile Picture Display Fix

## Problem
After uploading a profile picture on iOS, the image showed "Photo Placeholder" instead of the actual image, even though the upload was successful.

## Root Cause
React Native's `Image` component **does not support custom HTTP headers** like `Authorization: Bearer {token}`. Since the profile picture route requires JWT authentication, the image couldn't load without the auth token.

## Solution
Implemented authenticated image loading using `expo-file-system`:

### What Changed (ProfileScreen.js)
1. **Added expo-file-system import** - Enables downloading files with custom headers
2. **New loadProfileImage function** - Downloads the profile picture with JWT authentication and caches it locally
3. **Updated state management** - Uses local file URI instead of remote URL for displaying the image

### How It Works
```javascript
// 1. Fetch image with JWT token in headers
const downloadResult = await FileSystem.downloadAsync(
  `${BASE_URL}${imageUrl}`,
  fileUri,
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  }
);

// 2. Display from local cache
setProfileImageUri(downloadResult.uri);
```

## Testing on iOS
1. Scan the QR code with Expo Go app
2. Login to your account
3. Go to Profile screen
4. Tap the camera icon to upload a profile picture
5. After upload, the image should now display correctly ‚úÖ

## No Railway Deployment Needed
This fix is **iOS app only** - no backend changes required! The changes are:
- ‚úÖ Already applied to local Replit (Expo Server restarted)
- ‚úÖ Ready to test immediately on your iOS device
- ‚ùå No need to push to Railway (backend code unchanged)

## Technical Details
- **Before**: Image component tried to load authenticated URL ‚Üí Failed (no header support)
- **After**: Download image with auth ‚Üí Cache locally ‚Üí Display from cache ‚Üí Success!
- **Cache location**: `${FileSystem.cacheDirectory}profile_picture.jpg`
- **Refresh mechanism**: Timestamp query parameter prevents stale cache

The profile picture will now load correctly on iOS Railway production! üéâ
