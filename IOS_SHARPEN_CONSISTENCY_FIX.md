# iOS Sharpen Function Consistency Fix

## Issue Fixed
The iOS/mobile sharpen function was inconsistent with the web application's sharpen function, causing potential issues and missing features.

## Changes Made

### Mobile API Sharpen Function (`photovault/routes/mobile_api.py`)

**Updated to match web version:**

1. **Uses same enhancer method** - Changed from `sharpen_image()` to `enhancer.sharpen_image()`
2. **Stores enhancement metadata** - Now saves all sharpening settings to `photo.enhancement_metadata` like web version
3. **Supports all parameters** - Accepts `intensity` (iOS) or `amount` (web), plus `radius`, `threshold`, `method`
4. **Consistent filename format** - Changed from `{user}.sharpened.{date}.{random}.jpg` to `{user}.{date}.sharp.{random}.jpg`
5. **Maintains Railway persistence** - Still uploads to app_storage for Railway compatibility
6. **Improved error handling** - Matches web version's error messages

### Key Improvements

✅ **Consistency** - Both web and iOS now use identical sharpening logic  
✅ **Metadata Tracking** - All sharpening settings are stored in database  
✅ **Flexibility** - Supports both iOS (`intensity`) and web (`amount`) parameter names  
✅ **Railway Compatible** - Includes app_storage upload for production persistence  

## Deployment to Railway

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py
git commit -m "Fix iOS sharpen function to match web application"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Deployment

Railway will automatically deploy your changes. Monitor the deployment:

1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Check deployment logs for success
3. Verify no errors during build/deploy

### Step 3: Test on iOS App

1. Open StoryKeep iOS app (connected to Railway production)
2. Select a photo
3. Tap "Enhance" and try sharpening with different intensities
4. Verify sharpened photos appear correctly
5. Check that metadata is saved (settings should persist)

### Step 4: Verify Database

Check that photos have proper enhancement metadata:

```sql
SELECT id, filename, edited_filename, enhancement_metadata 
FROM photos 
WHERE enhancement_metadata IS NOT NULL 
AND enhancement_metadata::text LIKE '%sharpening%'
LIMIT 10;
```

Should show records with structure:
```json
{
  "sharpening": {
    "radius": 2.0,
    "amount": 1.5,
    "threshold": 3,
    "method": "unsharp",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-16 12:00:00"
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Local Testing (Replit)
- [x] Web sharpening works (Toolkit → Sharpening)
- [x] CSRF token error fixed
- [x] Mobile API updated and server restarted
- [ ] Test with iOS app pointed to local Replit

### Production Testing (Railway)
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Railway deployment successful
- [ ] iOS sharpen feature works on Railway
- [ ] Metadata stored correctly in database
- [ ] Sharpened images persist after deployment

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. Revert the mobile_api.py changes:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Railway will auto-deploy the previous version

## Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility - iOS apps using `intensity` parameter will continue to work
- Web application can also use the same endpoint if needed
- Enhancement metadata enables future features like "view sharpening history" or "undo sharpening"
