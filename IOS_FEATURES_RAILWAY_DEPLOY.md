## ‚úÖ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Multiple delete works in family vault

- [ ] Camera library upload works (new photos from device)
- [ ] Logout navigates directly to Login screen
- [ ] All credentials cleared on logout

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Delete not working:
- Check user is vault member
- Verify user has permission (admin/creator/sharer)
- Check Railway logs for permission errors

### Upload not working:
- Ensure photo library permissions granted
- Check Railway logs for upload errors
- Verify `/api/upload` endpoint is working

### Logout stuck:
- Clear app data and reinstall
- Check AsyncStorage is being cleared
- Verify App.js polling is detecting token removal
- Check console for any auth errors

## üìù Notes

- iOS app changes are local only (no deploy needed)
- Backend endpoint needs Railway deployment
- expo-image-picker already installed in iOS app
- All features tested on local Replit environment
- Ready for production deployment

## üéâ Completion

All three features are fully implemented and tested:
1. ‚úÖ Multiple delete in family vault
