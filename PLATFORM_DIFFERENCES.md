# StoryKeep Platform Differences: Mobile vs Web

## Overview
StoryKeep is designed with two complementary interfaces, each optimized for its specific use case:

- **Mobile App (iOS)**: Focused on **legacy photo restoration**
- **Web Platform**: Full-featured **advanced editing suite**

This document explains the intentional differences between the platforms and the reasoning behind them.

## 📱 Mobile App (iOS) - Legacy Photo Restoration

### Purpose
Designed for quickly digitizing and restoring old physical photos from albums and shoeboxes.

### Enhancement Features (3 Core Tools Only)

#### 1. 🔧 Sharpen
- **Use Case**: Fix old, blurry, or degraded physical photos
- **Endpoint**: `/api/photos/<photo_id>/sharpen`
- **Best For**: Photos that have lost clarity due to age or poor scanning

#### 2. 🎨 Colorize (DNN)
- **Use Case**: Fast colorization for most black & white photos
- **Endpoint**: `/api/photos/<photo_id>/colorize`
- **Algorithm**: Deep Neural Network (traditional method)
- **Best For**: Quick colorization of everyday B&W photos

#### 3. ✨ Colorize (AI)
- **Use Case**: Intelligent colorization for special photos
- **Endpoint**: `/api/photos/<photo_id>/colorize-ai`
- **Algorithm**: AI-powered with Gemini analysis
- **Best For**: Important photos requiring intelligent color decisions

### Why Only 3 Features?

**User Experience**: Mobile users are typically:
- On-the-go, digitizing family photo albums
- Need quick, focused tools for restoration
- Don't want overwhelming options while standing at grandma's house
- Want to preserve memories, not become photo editors

**Mobile Constraints**:
- Smaller screen = simpler UI needed
- Touch interface works better with fewer options
- Battery efficiency (fewer processing options)

### Implementation
**File**: `StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/EnhancePhotoScreen.js`

```javascript
// Simple, focused UI with only 3 options
<EnhancementOption
  icon="brush"
  title="Sharpen"
  description="Fix blurry or degraded photos"
/>
<EnhancementOption
  icon="color-palette"
  title="Colorize (DNN)"
  description="Fast colorization using DNN"
/>
<EnhancementOption
  icon="sparkles-outline"
  title="Colorize (AI)"
  description="Intelligent AI-powered colorization"
/>
```

- 🔆 **Contrast** (-100 to +100)
- 🌈 **Saturation** (-100 to +100)
- 🔄 **Rotation** (0° to 360°)

#### Markup Tools
- ✏️ **Pen** - Freehand drawing
- 🖍️ **Highlight** - Highlighting important areas
- ➡️ **Arrow** - Directional arrows
- ⬜ **Rectangle** - Rectangle shapes
- ⭕ **Circle** - Circle shapes
- 🔤 **Text** - Add text annotations

#### Advanced Features
- 🎨 **Color Picker** - Custom drawing colors
- 📏 **Line Width** - Adjustable stroke size
- 📝 **Font Size** - Adjustable text size
- 🎯 **Fill Shapes** - Solid or outline shapes
- ↩️ **Undo/Redo** - Full editing history

#### AI-Powered Enhancement
- 🎨 **Colorize (Traditional)** - DNN-based colorization
- ✨ **Colorize with AI** - Gemini AI-powered colorization
- 📊 **AI Enhancement Analysis** - Intelligent photo analysis

### Why All These Features?

**User Experience**: Web users are typically:
- At their desk with time to edit carefully
- Working on selected photos they want to perfect
- Need professional-grade tools
- Want complete control over the editing process

**Desktop Advantages**:
- Large screen = room for complex UI
- Mouse/keyboard = precise control
- No battery constraints
- Better for detailed work

### Implementation
**File**: `photovault/templates/editor.html`

```html
<!-- Comprehensive editing controls -->
<div class="mb-3">
  <label>Brightness</label>
  <input type="range" id="brightness" min="-100" max="100">
</div>
<div class="mb-3">
  <label>Contrast</label>
  <input type="range" id="contrast" min="-100" max="100">
</div>
<!-- ... and 15+ more tools -->
```

**File**: `photovault/templates/advanced_enhancement.html`
- Side-by-side before/after comparison
- OpenCV-powered enhancement
- Professional gradient UI

## 🚀 Development Notes

### Adding Features

#### To Mobile App:
- Think carefully: Does this fit "legacy restoration"?
- Keep it simple and focused
- Update `StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/EnhancePhotoScreen.js`

#### To Web Platform:
- Professional tools welcome
- Add to `photovault/templates/editor.html`
- Ensure responsive design

### API Endpoints

All mobile endpoints use JWT authentication:
```javascript
headers: {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${authToken}`
}
```

Web endpoints use session-based auth (Flask-Login).
