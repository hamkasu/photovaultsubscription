# Sharpen & Logout Fix - Railway Deployment Guide

## Summary of Fixes

### 1. ✅ Sharpen Photo Feature Fixed
**Issue:** Sharpen endpoint was failing with 400 error for photos larger than 10MB
**Fix:** Increased file size limit from 10MB to 50MB (aligned with MAX_FILE_SIZE)
**Files Changed:** `photovault/routes/mobile_api.py`

### 2. ✅ Logout Navigation Fixed  
**Issue:** Logout button didn't redirect to login screen smoothly
**Fix:** Optimized auth check interval to 500ms (battery-friendly) with 600ms logout wait
**Files Changed:**
- `StoryKeep-iOS/App.js` - Auth check interval optimized to 500ms
- `StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js` - Logout wait increased to 600ms
- `StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/SettingsScreen.js` - Logout wait increased to 600ms

## Architect Review Status
✅ **APPROVED** - Both fixes passed architect review
- Sharpen endpoint now aligns with MAX_FILE_SIZE (50MB)
- Auth check interval is battery-friendly (500ms = 2 checks/second)
- Logout navigation is smooth with 600ms wait

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit All Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Sharpen endpoint (50MB limit) & logout navigation (500ms interval)"
```

### 2. Push to Railway
```bash
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify on Railway
Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway to deploy, then verify:

**Test Sharpen:**
1. Open iOS app
2. Go to Gallery
3. Select a photo (any size up to 50MB)
4. Tap "Enhance Photo"
5. Tap "Sharpen"
6. Should work without 400 error

**Test Logout:**
1. Open iOS app
2. Tap profile icon or go to Settings
3. Tap "Logout"
4. Confirm logout
5. Should redirect to Login screen within 0.5-1 second

## Technical Details

### Sharpen Endpoint Change
```python
# BEFORE: Too restrictive
if file_size > 10 * 1024 * 1024:  # 10MB limit
    return jsonify({'error': 'Image too large...'}), 400

# AFTER: Aligned with MAX_FILE_SIZE
if file_size > 50 * 1024 * 1024:  # 50MB limit (same as MAX_FILE_SIZE)
    return jsonify({'error': 'Image too large...'}), 400
```

### Logout Navigation Change
```javascript
// BEFORE: Too aggressive (battery drain)
const interval = setInterval(checkAuthStatus, 100);  // 10 checks/second

// AFTER: Battery-friendly and responsive
const interval = setInterval(checkAuthStatus, 500);  // 2 checks/second

// Logout wait time adjusted to match
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 600));  // Ensures detection
```

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Sharpen Photo
- Photos up to 50MB can be sharpened successfully
- Larger photos will show clear error message
- Processing time depends on photo size

### Logout
- Logout button in Dashboard header works instantly
- Logout button in Settings screen works instantly
- Redirects to Login screen within 0.5-1 second
- No battery/CPU drain from aggressive polling

## Rollback Instructions (If Needed)

If issues occur after deployment:

```bash
# Revert the commit
git revert HEAD

# Push the revert
git push origin main
```

## Testing Checklist

After Railway deployment:
- [ ] Sharpen works on photos < 50MB
- [ ] Sharpen shows clear error for photos > 50MB
- [ ] Logout from Dashboard redirects to Login
- [ ] Logout from Settings redirects to Login
- [ ] No noticeable battery drain during normal use
- [ ] Navigation feels responsive (< 1 second)

## Notes

- The fixes are currently deployed locally on Replit for testing
- **Railway deployment is required** for iOS app to use the fixes
- iOS app connects to: `https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app`
- Local Replit environment is for development only
