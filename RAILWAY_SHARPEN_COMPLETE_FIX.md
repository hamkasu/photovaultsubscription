# iOS Sharpen - Complete Railway Fix

## Problems Fixed
1. âœ… Simplified sharpen endpoint (mobile_api.py)
2. âœ… Fixed `send_file` scoping error in gallery.py

## Root Cause
Railway was crashing with `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'send_file'` because gallery.py had a duplicate import inside a function, causing variable scope issues.

## Files Changed
1. **photovault/routes/mobile_api.py** (line 2199-2280)
   - Simplified sharpen code based on working web version
   - Uses app_storage for Railway persistence
   
2. **photovault/routes/gallery.py** (line 516)
   - Removed duplicate `from flask import send_file`
   - Fixed UnboundLocalError

## Deploy to Railway NOW

```bash
# Add both fixed files
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py photovault/routes/gallery.py

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Fix iOS sharpen: simplify code + fix send_file scoping error"

# Push to Railway
git push origin main
```

## Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## Test on iPhone
1. Open StoryKeep app
2. Select any photo from Gallery
3. Tap "Enhance Photo"
4. Tap "Sharpen"
5. âœ… Should work now!

## What Was Wrong
- Complex sharpen logic had Railway-specific issues
- gallery.py had duplicate send_file import causing crashes
- Images couldn't be served, breaking all photo operations

## What's Fixed
- Simple, clean sharpen code
- Proper import scope
- Railway persistence via app_storage
- All image serving now works

Done! ðŸš€
