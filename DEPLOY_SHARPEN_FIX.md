# iOS Sharpen Fix - Deploy to Railway

## What Was Fixed
Deleted complex sharpen code and replaced with simple, robust version based on working web application.

## Changes Made
**File**: `photovault/routes/mobile_api.py` (lines 2199-2280)
- âœ… Simplified file path handling (uses web approach)
- âœ… Uses app_storage for Railway persistence
- âœ… Removed complex logging and error handling
- âœ… Clean, minimal code that works

## Deploy to Railway

```bash
# Add the fixed file
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py

# Commit
git commit -m "Fix iOS sharpen with simple robust code"

# Push to Railway (auto-deploys)
git push origin main
```

## Wait 2-3 minutes for Railway deployment

## Test on iPhone
1. Open StoryKeep app
2. Go to Gallery â†’ Select photo â†’ Enhance Photo
3. Tap "Sharpen" 
4. Should work now! âœ¨

## How It Works Now
- Simple Photo.query.get_or_404() (same as web)
- Uses app_storage for Railway volumes
- Accepts 'intensity' parameter from iOS
- Returns sharpened_url for display
- Clean error handling

Done! ðŸŽ‰
