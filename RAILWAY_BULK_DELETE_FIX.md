# Railway Bulk Delete Fix - Deployment Guide

## Issue
The iOS app shows "Failed to delete photos" error when trying to delete multiple photos on Railway production.

**Error Details:**
- Error message: "Failed to delete photos"
- Console: "Bulk delete error: AxiosError: Request failed with status code 400"
- HTTP Status: 400 Bad Request (not 404)

## Root Cause - ROUTE CONFLICT ‚úÖ FIXED
The issue was a **route conflict** between two endpoints at the same path:

1. **Web endpoint** (`photo.py`): `/api/photos/bulk-delete` 
   - Uses `@login_required` (session cookies)
   - For web browser users

2. **Mobile endpoint** (`mobile_api.py`): `/api/photos/bulk-delete`
   - Uses `@token_required` (JWT tokens)  
   - For mobile app users

**What happened:**
- The web endpoint was registered first
- It caught ALL requests to `/api/photos/bulk-delete`
- When mobile app sent JWT token, web endpoint expected session cookie
- Result: **400 Bad Request**

**The Fix:**
- Changed mobile endpoint to unique path: `/api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile`
- Updated iOS app to use new endpoint
- No more route conflict ‚úÖ

## Solution - Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Verify Local Changes
The bulk delete endpoint has been FIXED in:
- **Backend File**: `photovault/routes/mobile_api.py`
  - **Old Route**: `POST /api/photos/bulk-delete` (conflicted with web)
  - **New Route**: `POST /api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile` ‚úÖ
  - **Lines**: 2212-2325

- **iOS App File**: `StoryKeep-iOS/src/services/api.js`
  - **Updated endpoint**: `/api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile` ‚úÖ

### Step 2: Commit and Push to GitHub

```bash
# Stage the changes
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py StoryKeep-iOS/src/services/api.js

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix bulk delete route conflict - use /api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile for iOS app"

# Push to GitHub (Railway will auto-deploy)
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Railway Deployment
- Railway will automatically detect the GitHub push
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment to complete
- Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

### Step 4: Verify on iOS App
1. Open the iOS app (connected to Railway)
2. Go to Gallery
3. Long-press a photo to enter selection mode
4. Select multiple photos (2-3 photos)
5. Tap the üóëÔ∏è (trash) icon
6. Confirm deletion
7. **Expected**: Success message "Deleted X photos"
8. **Previously**: Error "Failed to delete photos"

## Endpoint Details

### New Mobile Endpoint (Fixed)
```http
POST /api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile
Authorization: Bearer {JWT_TOKEN}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "photo_ids": [123, 456, 789]
}
```

### Old Web Endpoint (Conflicted)
```http
POST /api/photos/bulk-delete
Cookie: session={SESSION_COOKIE}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "photo_ids": [123, 456, 789]
}
```
*Note: This endpoint is for web users only*

### Response Format (Success)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Deleted 3 photos",
  "deleted_count": 3,
  "failed_count": 0,
  "errors": null
}
```

### Response Format (Error)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Bulk delete failed: {reason}"
}
```

## Features of the Endpoint
‚úÖ Deletes multiple photos in one request  
‚úÖ Removes all associated files (original, thumbnail, edited versions)  
‚úÖ Cleans up voice memos, vault associations, tags, and comments  
‚úÖ Tracks success/failure counts  
‚úÖ Provides detailed error reporting  
‚úÖ Verifies user ownership before deletion  
‚úÖ Uses JWT authentication  
‚úÖ CSRF exempt for mobile API  

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Single photo deletion still works
- [ ] Multiple photo selection (2-5 photos)
- [ ] Bulk deletion success message shows correct count
- [ ] Deleted photos disappear from gallery
- [ ] No orphaned files left in storage
- [ ] Voice memos are cleaned up
- [ ] Vault associations are removed

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur after deployment:
1. Revert the commit: `git revert HEAD`
2. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
3. Railway will auto-deploy the rollback
4. Report the issue for investigation

## Summary

### What Was Wrong
- Route conflict: Both web and mobile used `/api/photos/bulk-delete`
- Web endpoint (session auth) was registered first
- Mobile app JWT requests hit web endpoint ‚Üí 400 error

### What Was Fixed
- Mobile endpoint renamed to `/api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile`
- iOS app updated to use new endpoint
- Both endpoints now work independently ‚úÖ

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED LOCALLY** - Route conflict resolved, unique endpoints for web and mobile  
‚ö†Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED** - Push changes to GitHub for Railway deployment

```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py StoryKeep-iOS/src/services/api.js
git commit -m "Fix bulk delete route conflict - use /api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile for iOS app"
git push origin main
```
