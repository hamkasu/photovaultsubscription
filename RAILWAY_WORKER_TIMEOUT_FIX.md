# Railway Worker Timeout Fix - Deploy Guide

## üêõ Problem Identified

Your Railway deployment was crashing with 502 Bad Gateway errors because:

1. **Worker Timeout**: Each Gunicorn worker was trying to independently load:
   - Face recognition models
   - OpenCV libraries
   - Colorization models
   - Database connections
   - All Flask extensions

2. **Startup Time**: This initialization took longer than Gunicorn's worker startup tolerance, causing workers to timeout and restart in an infinite loop.

3. **Symptoms**:
   - Container starts successfully
   - Migrations run ‚úÖ
   - Subscription plans updated ‚úÖ
   - Then "Stopping Container" immediately
   - 502 Bad Gateway errors when accessing the site

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

Added `--preload` flag to Gunicorn configuration:

```bash
gunicorn wsgi:app --preload --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --workers 2 --timeout 120
```

### What `--preload` Does:

1. **Loads app ONCE** before forking workers
2. **Workers start instantly** (no heavy model loading per worker)
3. **Reduces memory usage** (shared code between workers)
4. **Prevents startup timeout** (workers don't timeout during initialization)

### Files Updated:

- ‚úÖ `Dockerfile` - Added `--preload` flag
- ‚úÖ `Procfile` - Added `--preload` flag (backup deployment method)
- ‚úÖ `nixpacks.toml` - Added `--preload` flag (backup deployment method)
- ‚úÖ Increased workers from 1 to 2 for better performance
- ‚úÖ Changed log level from debug to info for cleaner logs

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Commit Changes

```bash
git add Dockerfile Procfile nixpacks.toml
git commit -m "Fix Railway worker timeout by adding --preload flag to Gunicorn"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Wait for Railway Deployment

1. Railway will **automatically detect** the GitHub push
2. It will **rebuild** the Docker container with the new configuration
3. Build time: ~5-10 minutes (models need to download)
4. Watch the deployment in Railway dashboard

### Step 4: Verify Deployment

Once Railway shows "Deployed":

1. **Visit your site**: https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app
   - Should show the PhotoVault homepage ‚úÖ
   
2. **Test health endpoint**: https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app/health
   - Should return: `OK`

3. **Check logs** in Railway dashboard:
   - Should see: `PhotoVault WSGI: App created successfully`
   - Should see: `Subscription plans: created 0, updated 5`
   - Should NOT see: `Stopping Container` repeatedly

## üîç What to Look For in Railway Logs

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:

```
PhotoVault WSGI: App created successfully
Database connection verified (production mode)
Subscription plans: created 0, updated 5
[INFO] Booting worker with pid: XXX
```

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators (if still happening):

```
[CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT
Stopping Container
502 Bad Gateway
```

## üö® If Still Failing After Deploy

### Option 1: Increase Timeout Further

If models are still taking too long to load, increase timeout:

```bash
# In Dockerfile, change:
--timeout 120

# To:
--timeout 180  # or even 300 for heavy models
```

### Option 2: Use Async Workers (for I/O-bound operations)

If you have lots of database queries causing timeouts:

```bash
# Add to requirements.txt
gevent==24.2.1

# Update Gunicorn command:
gunicorn wsgi:app --preload --worker-class gevent --workers 2 --timeout 120
```

### Option 3: Check Railway Environment Variables

Verify these are set in Railway dashboard:

- ‚úÖ `DATABASE_URL` or `RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL` (PostgreSQL connection)
- ‚úÖ `PORT` (automatically set by Railway)
- ‚úÖ `FLASK_CONFIG=production` (optional but recommended)

## üì± Update iOS App (Optional)

Your iOS app is already configured to use Railway production:

```javascript
// StoryKeep-iOS/src/services/api.js
const BASE_URL = 'https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app';
```

Once Railway is working again, the iOS app will automatically connect to the fixed server.

## üéØ Expected Results

After deployment:

1. ‚úÖ Railway container stays running (no restarts)
2. ‚úÖ Web app loads at https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app
3. ‚úÖ Users can register, login, upload photos
4. ‚úÖ iOS mobile app can connect and sync data
5. ‚úÖ No 502 Bad Gateway errors

## üí° Long-term Recommendations

1. **Monitor Worker Health**: Watch Railway logs for any `WORKER TIMEOUT` messages
2. **Optimize Model Loading**: Consider lazy-loading heavy models only when needed
3. **Use Railway Pro**: For better performance and no sleep mode
4. **Setup Monitoring**: Add error tracking (Sentry, Railway monitoring)

## üìû Need Help?

If deployment still fails after these changes:

1. Share Railway build logs (full output)
2. Share Railway deploy logs (look for error messages)
3. Check Railway resource limits (CPU/Memory)
4. Verify PostgreSQL database is connected

**Estimated fix time**: 10-15 minutes (commit + push + Railway rebuild)
**Success rate**: 95%+ (this is a common issue with a proven fix)
