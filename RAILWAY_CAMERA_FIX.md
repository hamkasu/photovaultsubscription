# ðŸ“¸ Railway Camera Upload Fix - Deployment Guide

## Problem Fixed
The iOS camera/digitizer was showing "Upload Failed" because the `/api/detect-and-extract` endpoint was expecting a JSON request with a `photo_id`, but the iOS app was sending a file upload via FormData.

## Solution Implemented
âœ… Rewrote `/api/detect-and-extract` endpoint to accept file uploads directly
âœ… Added proper file validation and error handling
âœ… Handles both multi-photo detection and single image uploads
âœ… Creates thumbnails and saves to database correctly

## Files Changed
- `photovault/routes/mobile_api.py` - Fixed `/api/detect-and-extract` endpoint

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py
git commit -m "Fix iOS camera upload - accept file uploads in detect-and-extract endpoint"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Railway Auto-Deploy
Railway will automatically detect the push and deploy the changes. You can monitor the deployment in your Railway dashboard.

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Wait for Railway deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
2. Open your iOS app
3. Go to Camera/Digitizer
4. Take a photo of some printed photos
5. The upload should now work successfully!

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- âœ… Camera captures photo
- âœ… Photo uploads successfully to Railway
- âœ… Photos are detected and extracted automatically
- âœ… Success message shows number of photos extracted
- âœ… Photos appear in Gallery

## Need Help?
If the deployment doesn't work:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify the commit was pushed to GitHub
3. Ensure Railway is connected to the correct repository and branch
4. Try triggering a manual redeploy in Railway dashboard
