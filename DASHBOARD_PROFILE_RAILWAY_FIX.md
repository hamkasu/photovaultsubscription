# Dashboard Profile Picture Fix - Railway Deployment Guide

## üîß Issue Fixed
The iOS Dashboard was not displaying the user's profile picture on Railway production, even though the Profile screen showed it correctly.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied
Completely rewrote the Dashboard profile picture loading logic to **ALWAYS fetch fresh data from the database**:

### What Changed:
1. **Fresh Database Fetch**: Dashboard now calls `authAPI.getProfile()` every time it loads or comes into focus
2. **No Caching Issues**: Uses unique filenames with timestamps for each download to prevent stale cache
3. **Better UX**: Added loading spinner while fetching profile picture
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added console logs to track the entire process for debugging
5. **Same Pattern as Profile**: Uses the exact same proven `FileSystem.downloadAsync()` approach that works in Profile screen

### Key Improvements:
```javascript
// Before: Could show stale/cached images
setProfileImageUri(downloadResult.uri);

// After: Fresh download with unique filename every time
const timestamp = Date.now();
const fileUri = `${FileSystem.cacheDirectory}dashboard_profile_${timestamp}.jpg`;
```

## üì± iOS App Changes (Already Applied Locally)

### Modified File:
- `StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js`

### Changes Summary:
1. Added `refreshProfilePicture()` function that ALWAYS fetches fresh user data
2. Added `useFocusEffect` hook to reload profile picture when returning to Dashboard
3. Added unique timestamp to cache filenames to prevent cache issues
4. Added loading state (`profileLoading`) with spinner indicator
5. Added comprehensive console logs for debugging

## üöÇ No Railway Backend Changes Needed

The backend API (`/api/auth/profile`) is already working correctly - it returns the `profile_picture` column from the user table. This fix is **iOS-only**.

## üì§ Deployment Steps

### 1. Push iOS Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add StoryKeep-iOS/src/screens/DashboardScreen.js
git commit -m "Fix: Dashboard profile picture now always fetches from database"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Test on Railway Production
1. **Open Expo Go** on your iOS device
2. **Scan the QR code** to load the app
3. **Login** to your account
4. **Go to Profile** screen (should show profile picture - already working ‚úì)
5. **Go back to Dashboard** (should now show profile picture ‚úì)
6. **Pull down to refresh** Dashboard (should reload profile picture ‚úì)

### 3. Check Logs for Debugging
If the profile picture still doesn't show, check the Expo console logs for:
- `üì± Dashboard focused - reloading profile picture...`
- `üë§ Fresh profile data from database: {...}`
- `üì• Downloading fresh profile picture from database...`
- `‚úÖ Profile image loaded successfully`

## üîç How It Works Now

### When Dashboard Loads:
1. Calls `authAPI.getProfile()` ‚Üí Gets fresh user data from database
2. Checks if `profile_picture` column has a value
3. Downloads image with auth token using `FileSystem.downloadAsync()`
4. Saves to unique cache file: `dashboard_profile_${timestamp}.jpg`
5. Displays the image

### When Returning from Profile:
1. `useFocusEffect` hook triggers
2. Calls `refreshProfilePicture()` to get fresh database data
3. Downloads new image file with new timestamp
4. Updates display

### Why This Works:
- **No Cache Issues**: Each download uses a unique filename
- **Always Fresh**: Fetches from database every time
- **Same as Profile**: Uses the exact pattern that works in Profile screen
- **Well Logged**: Console shows exactly what's happening

## üìä Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Working Correctly:
- Dashboard shows profile picture immediately on load
- Profile picture updates when you return from Profile screen
- Pull-to-refresh reloads the profile picture
- Loading spinner shows while fetching

### ‚ùå If Still Not Working:
1. Check Expo console logs for error messages
2. Verify the user has a `profile_picture` value in the database
3. Confirm the `/api/auth/profile` endpoint returns `profile_picture` field
4. Check that the image URL starts with `/uploads/`

## üéØ Summary

This fix ensures the Dashboard **ALWAYS** pulls the profile picture from the `profile_picture` column in the user table, with zero caching issues. The implementation matches the working Profile screen pattern exactly.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed locally, ready for production testing
**Backend Changes**: None required
**iOS Changes**: Applied and running
**Next Step**: Test on Railway production
