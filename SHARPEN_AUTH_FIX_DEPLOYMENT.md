# ðŸ”§ Sharpen Authentication Fix - Railway Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed
The sharpen feature was failing on the Railway production server with "Authorization token is missing" error because it was using JWT-only authentication instead of supporting both web (session-based) and mobile (JWT) authentication.

## What Was Changed
Updated the sharpen endpoint in `photovault/routes/photo.py` to use **hybrid authentication** that supports both:
- âœ… **Web users**: Session-based authentication (cookies)
- âœ… **Mobile users**: JWT token authentication

### Code Change
```python
# Before (JWT-only or session-only)
@photo_bp.route('/api/photos/<int:photo_id>/sharpen', methods=['POST'])
@login_required  # or @token_required
def sharpen_photo_api(photo_id):

# After (Hybrid - supports both)
@photo_bp.route('/api/photos/<int:photo_id>/sharpen', methods=['POST'])
@hybrid_auth
def sharpen_photo_api(current_user, photo_id):
```

## How to Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add photovault/routes/photo.py
git commit -m "Fix sharpen endpoint authentication - support both web and mobile"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Railway Auto-Deploy
Railway will automatically detect the changes and deploy the updated code. You can monitor the deployment at:
- Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/

### Step 4: Verify the Fix
1. **Test Web Sharpening**:
   - Go to: `https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app`
   - Login to your account
   - Go to Advanced Enhancement page
   - Select a photo
   - Click "Sharpen" button
   - Should work without "Authorization token is missing" error âœ…

2. **Test Mobile Sharpening** (if applicable):
   - Open iOS app
   - Select a photo
   - Apply sharpen enhancement
   - Should work with JWT authentication âœ…

## Technical Details

### Hybrid Authentication Flow
1. **First Check**: Looks for JWT token in `Authorization` header
2. **Fallback**: If no JWT, uses session-based authentication (cookies)
3. **Result**: Works for both web browsers and mobile apps

### Files Modified
- `photovault/routes/photo.py` (line 1567-1568)

## Expected Results
- âœ… Web users can sharpen photos without authentication errors
- âœ… Mobile users can sharpen photos with JWT tokens
- âœ… Sharpen feature works on both local development and Railway production

## Troubleshooting

If sharpening still fails after deployment:

1. **Check Railway Logs**:
   ```bash
   # View Railway deployment logs
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Ensure the latest commit is deployed
   - Check Railway dashboard for deployment status

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

4. **Test Authentication**:
   - Logout and login again
   - Ensure session is valid

## Notes
- This fix also benefits other enhancement features that need hybrid authentication
- The `hybrid_auth` decorator is located in `photovault/utils/jwt_auth.py`
- All enhancement endpoints should use `@hybrid_auth` for maximum compatibility
