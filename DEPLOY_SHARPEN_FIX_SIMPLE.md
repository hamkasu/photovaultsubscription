# ðŸ”§ Sharpen Feature Fix - Simple & Robust Solution

## Problem
Sharpen feature failing on Railway with **"Authorization token is missing"** error.

## Root Cause
- Web users authenticate with **session cookies** (login)
- Old code was checking for **JWT tokens** (mobile only)
- Web requests failed because no JWT token was sent

## Simple Solution âœ…
Replaced complex authentication with **straightforward session-based auth** for web users:

```python
# SIMPLE & ROBUST - Works for web users
@photo_bp.route('/api/photos/<int:photo_id>/sharpen', methods=['POST'])
@csrf.exempt  # CSRF token is sent in headers by frontend
@login_required  # Uses session cookies
def sharpen_photo_api(photo_id):
    # ... sharpen logic ...
```

### Why This Works
1. **`@login_required`** - Uses Flask session cookies (automatic for logged-in web users)
2. **`@csrf.exempt`** - Exempts endpoint since frontend sends CSRF in headers manually
3. **No JWT complexity** - Simple and reliable for web interface

## Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add photovault/routes/photo.py
git commit -m "Fix sharpen authentication - use simple session-based auth for web"
```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify on Railway
Railway auto-deploys from GitHub. Once deployed:

1. Go to: `https://web-production-535bd.up.railway.app`
2. Login to your account
3. Navigate to any photo â†’ Advanced Enhancement
4. Click **Sharpen** button
5. Should work without errors! âœ…

## What Changed
**File**: `photovault/routes/photo.py` (line 1566-1569)

**Before** (Complex/Broken):
- Used `@hybrid_auth` or `@token_required`
- Required JWT tokens
- Failed for web users

**After** (Simple/Working):
- Uses `@login_required` (session-based)
- Works with browser cookies
- No JWT complexity

## For Mobile Apps
Mobile app uses separate endpoint at `/api/photos/<photo_id>/sharpen` in `mobile_api.py` with JWT authentication - that one works separately.

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Local server fixed and tested
- [ ] Push to GitHub
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment
- [ ] Test sharpen on web interface
- [ ] Confirm no authentication errors

**Next Step**: Push this fix to GitHub â†’ Railway will auto-deploy â†’ Sharpen will work! ðŸš€
