Next step: Deploy to Railway by pushing changes to GitHub

[x] 313. Fix environment after system restart - COMPLETED: Reinstalled all Python dependencies from requirements.txt
[x] 314. Install Expo in StoryKeep-iOS directory - COMPLETED: Installed expo and 742 packages successfully
[x] 315. Restart both workflows - COMPLETED: PhotoVault Server running on port 5000, Expo Server with tunnel at exp://gdmexb4-anonymous-8081.exp.direct and QR code ready

[x] 324. Restart Expo Server with fix - COMPLETED: Server running at exp://gdmexb4-anonymous-8081.exp.direct

## ✅ COLORIZATION VIEW BUTTON FIX COMPLETE
Fixed the issue where clicking "View" after colorization showed the old black & white photo instead of the colorized version:
- **Root Cause**: navigation.goBack() didn't refresh photo data on previous screen
- **Solution**: Fetch updated photo via photoAPI.getPhotoDetail() and navigate with new data
- **Applied To**: Both handleColorize (DNN & AI) and handleSharpen for consistency
- **Architect Reviewed**: Approved - API call and navigation pattern are correct

[x] 325. Debug 404 error after View button fix - COMPLETED: Identified missing /api/photos/<photo_id> endpoint

[x] 327. Restart PhotoVault Server with new endpoint - COMPLETED: Server running on port 5000 with all endpoints
[x] 328. Architect review of new endpoint - COMPLETED: Approved - security verified, data format correct

## ✅ COLORIZATION VIEW BUTTON - COMPLETE FIX
The 404 error has been resolved by adding the missing photo detail endpoint:
- **Issue**: iOS app was calling `/api/photos/<photo_id>` which didn't exist (404 error)
- **Solution**: Created new GET `/api/photos/<photo_id>` endpoint in mobile_api.py
- **Security**: Endpoint checks user_id matches current_user (no cross-account access)
- **Data Format**: Returns same format as gallery with original_url and edited_url
- **Ready to Test**: Local server updated, needs Railway deployment for production

[x] 329. Fix environment after system restart - COMPLETED: Reinstalled all Python dependencies from requirements.txt
[x] 330. Install Expo in StoryKeep-iOS directory - COMPLETED: Installed expo and 742 packages successfully
[x] 331. Restart both workflows - COMPLETED: PhotoVault Server running on port 5000, Expo Server with tunnel at exp://23m_1yo-anonymous-8081.exp.direct and QR code ready
[x] 332. Final verification - COMPLETED: Both servers running successfully with no critical errors
    - PhotoVault Server: Running on port 5000 with database initialized and all requests handling properly
    - Expo Server: Running with tunnel at exp://23m_1yo-anonymous-8081.exp.direct with QR code displayed
    - Web interface: StoryKeep homepage loading correctly with branding

[x] 335. Update EnhancePhotoScreen to use backend detection - COMPLETED: Replaced broken local logic with proper OpenCV-based API call
[x] 336. Restart both workflows with grayscale fix - COMPLETED: PhotoVault Server and Expo Server running successfully
[x] 337. Final verification - COMPLETED: Black and white detection now properly recognizes grayscale photos

## ✅ BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO DETECTION FIX COMPLETE
Fixed the issue where the app didn't properly recognize black and white photos for colorization:
- **Root Cause**: iOS app wasn't actually checking if photos were grayscale - just making assumptions based on metadata
- **Backend Solution**: Created `/api/photos/<photo_id>/check-grayscale` endpoint using OpenCV's color channel analysis
- **iOS Solution**: Updated EnhancePhotoScreen to call backend API for accurate grayscale detection
- **Detection Method**: Compares RGB channels - if max difference < 30, it's grayscale (accounts for compression artifacts)
- **Result**: Colorization buttons now properly enabled/disabled based on actual photo color content
- **Ready to Deploy**: Local servers updated, needs Railway deployment for production

[x] 338. Fix "View" button not showing colorized photo - COMPLETED: PhotoDetail now defaults to showing edited version when it exists
[x] 339. Update PhotoDetailScreen default view - COMPLETED: Changed showOriginal initial state to !initialPhoto.edited_url
[x] 340. Restart Expo Server with View fix - COMPLETED: Server running with updated PhotoDetail logic

## ✅ COLORIZED PHOTO VIEW FIX COMPLETE
Fixed the issue where clicking "View" after colorization didn't show the colorized photo:
- **Root Cause**: PhotoDetailScreen defaulted to showing original photo (showOriginal = true)
- **Solution**: Changed showOriginal initial state to !initialPhoto.edited_url (defaults to edited when available)
- **Result**: PhotoDetailScreen now shows colorized/enhanced version first when it exists

## ✅ BULK DELETE ROUTE CONFLICT FIX COMPLETE
Fixed the "Failed to delete photos" error in iOS app on Railway:
- **Root Cause**: Route conflict - both web and mobile used same path `/api/photos/bulk-delete`
- **Web Endpoint**: Uses session cookies (@login_required)
- **Mobile Endpoint**: Uses JWT tokens (@token_required)
- **The Issue**: Web endpoint registered first, caught mobile JWT requests, returned 400 error
- **The Fix**: 
  - Mobile endpoint renamed to `/api/photos/bulk-delete-mobile` ✅
  - iOS app updated to call new endpoint ✅
  - Both endpoints now coexist without conflict ✅
- **Status**: Fixed locally, ready for Railway deployment
