# 🚀 Railway iOS Fixes - Complete Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Camera/Digitizer Upload Error
**Problem:** iOS camera showed "Upload Failed" when taking photos  
**Solution:** Rewrote `/api/detect-and-extract` to accept file uploads directly instead of expecting photo_id

### 2. ✅ Vault Details Loading Error  
**Problem:** Vault details showed "Failed to load vault details" error  
**Solution:** Improved vault access logic and added VaultPhoto to top-level imports

## Files Changed

### photovault/routes/mobile_api.py
- **Line 8:** Added `VaultPhoto` to imports
- **Lines 385-550:** Fixed `/api/detect-and-extract` to accept multipart file uploads
- **Lines 593-664:** Improved `/api/family/vault/<vault_id>` with better access checks and logging

## 🚀 Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Commit Changes
```bash
git add photovault/routes/mobile_api.py
git commit -m "Fix iOS camera upload and vault details endpoints"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Railway Deployment
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Wait for automatic deployment to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. Check deployment logs for any errors

### Step 3: Test on iOS

#### Test Camera/Digitizer:
1. Open StoryKeep app on iOS
2. Go to Camera tab
3. Take a photo of some printed photos
4. ✅ Should upload successfully and extract photos

#### Test Vault Details:
1. Go to Vaults tab
2. Tap on a vault (e.g., "HAMKA BIN SULEIMAN")
3. ✅ Should load vault details without errors
4. ✅ Should show photos and members correctly

## Expected Behavior After Deployment

### Camera:
- ✅ Photo captures successfully
- ✅ Uploads to Railway
- ✅ Photos detected and extracted automatically
- ✅ Success message shows number of photos extracted
- ✅ Photos appear in Gallery

### Vaults:
- ✅ Vault list loads correctly
- ✅ Tap on vault opens details without errors
- ✅ Shows vault photos and members
- ✅ Can add photos to vault

## Troubleshooting

### If Camera Still Fails:
1. Check Railway logs for `/api/detect-and-extract` errors
2. Verify file upload is enabled in Railway
3. Check file size limits

### If Vault Details Still Fail:
1. Check Railway logs for `/api/family/vault/<id>` errors
2. Verify VaultPhoto model is migrated in Railway database
3. Check user has access to the vault (creator or active member)

### Manual Redeploy:
If auto-deploy doesn't work:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click "Redeploy" button

## Debug Logging
Both endpoints now have emoji logging for easy debugging:
- 🎯 = Request started
- ✅ = Success
- ❌ = Error
- 📋 = Fetching data
- 💾 = Saving data

Check Railway logs to see these debug messages.
