## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The platform utilizes HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla + jQuery patterns) with Jinja2 templating for the frontend. Responsive design is achieved using Bootstrap patterns. A unified photo card component system ensures consistent display of photos across all gallery pages, with a responsive CSS Grid layout (4-column desktop, 3-column tablet, 2-column mobile). Action buttons (View, Download, Edit, Delete) and filename/timestamp overlays are standardized across photo cards.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Flask 3.0.3, using PostgreSQL (via Neon on Replit) as the database and SQLAlchemy 2.0.25 for ORM. Alembic via Flask-Migrate handles database migrations. Flask-Login manages authentication, and Flask-WTF + WTForms are used for forms. Gunicorn 21.2.0 serves the application in production.

Image processing leverages Pillow 11.0.0 and OpenCV 4.12.0.88 (headless), with NumPy and scikit-image for scientific computing. AI integration uses Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for intelligent photo colorization and analysis. Replit Object Storage is used for persistent image storage, with a smart fallback to local storage.

- Offline queue using AsyncStorage - capture photos without internet, upload later
- Upload service with progress tracking, retry logic, and batch processing
- JWT authentication with secure token storage
- React Navigation with Login, Register, Home, and Camera screens
- Integration with backend API endpoints for seamless synchronization
