## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla + jQuery patterns) with Jinja2 templating, and Bootstrap patterns for responsive design. A unified photo card component system ensures consistent display with a responsive CSS Grid layout (4-column desktop, 3-column tablet, 2-column mobile). Action buttons (View, Download, Edit, Delete) and filename/timestamp overlays are standardized.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with Flask 3.0.3, PostgreSQL (via Neon on Replit), and SQLAlchemy 2.0.25 for ORM. Alembic via Flask-Migrate handles database migrations. Flask-Login manages authentication, and Flask-WTF + WTForms are used for forms. Gunicorn 21.2.0 serves the application in production. Image processing uses Pillow 11.3.0 with pillow-heif 1.1.1 for HEIC/HEIF support, and OpenCV 4.12.0.88 (headless), with NumPy and scikit-image. AI integration leverages Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for intelligent photo colorization and analysis. Replit Object Storage is used for persistent image storage with local storage fallback.

The Mobile Digitizer App (iOS & Android) is a professional photo digitalization tool built with React Native/Expo, featuring:
- Smart camera with real-time edge detection, visual guides, and auto-capture.
- Batch capture mode.
- Flash control.
- Client-side photo enhancement (brightness, contrast, sharpness, denoise).
- Server-side AI photo detection and extraction via `/api/detect-and-extract`.
- Offline queue using AsyncStorage for capturing without internet.
- Upload service with progress tracking and batch processing.
- JWT authentication with secure token storage and automatic logout detection (500ms polling).
- React Navigation for seamless user experience.
- Family vault photo management with multi-select deletion and permission-based access control.
- Device photo library upload via Expo ImagePicker for direct vault uploads.
- Gallery bulk share to family vaults with efficient bulk API endpoint, loading overlay, and intelligent retry logic for failed photos.
- Enhanced dashboard with 30% larger stat icons (42px), Vaults stat display with green highlight, and accurate vault counting using set-based deduplication to prevent double-counting of creators who are also members.

Voice memo recording and playback are supported using expo-av (.m4a format), with secure playback and automatic temp file cleanup.

Profile picture uploads support HEIC/HEIF formats (iOS default) with automatic conversion to JPEG for universal compatibility. The upload endpoint uses a temp file pattern with robust error handling to prevent corrupted files.

### Cross-Platform Mobile Support
The mobile app is fully cross-platform, supporting both iOS and Android with platform-specific adaptations:
- **iOS**: Face ID/Touch ID biometric authentication, iOS-specific UI patterns
- **Android**: Fingerprint/Face Unlock biometric authentication, Material Design patterns, hardware back button support
- **StatusBar**: Platform-optimized status bar configuration
- **KeyboardAvoidingView**: Platform-specific keyboard handling (iOS: padding, Android: height)
- **Permissions**: Platform-appropriate permission requests for camera, storage, and biometric access

### Feature Specifications
